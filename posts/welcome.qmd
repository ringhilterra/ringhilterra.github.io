Welcome to my blog on football analytics.

I'm a Senior Data Scientist at CrowdStrike by day, building AI/ML systems for cybersecurity. By night and on weekends, I apply those same data science skills to my passion: football (soccer) analytics.

Here I'll share technical write-ups, analysis, and insights from my work with tracking data, metrics development, and more.

Stay tuned for deep dives into projects like the Active Support Index (ASI) and other football analytics explorations.
