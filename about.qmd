Experienced Data Scientist leading ML and AI initiatives at CrowdStrike. Currently building Agentic AI and large-scale detection models that enhance SOC workflows.

I also enjoy applying my data science and AI background to football (soccer) in my spare time. Recent work: the Active Support Index (ASI)—a novel metric for quantifying off-ball movement during pressure situations. Developed and validated on 10 A-League 2024/25 matches containing 7,063 pressure events and 8 million+ tracking data points from SkillCorner. Submitted to the SkillCorner x PySport Analytics Cup.
