A team with 95% ASI means only 5% of pressure moments had zero active support.\n\n\nAvg Active Supporters\nMean number of teammates moving &gt;2 m/s within 35m when ball carrier is pressed\nHigher = Better. More teammates in motion = more passing options and defensive support.\n\n\nStatic Rate\nProportion of pressure events where no nearby teammate was moving &gt;2 m/s\nLower = Better. High static rate indicates teammates “ball-watching” instead of creating options.\n\n\n\nQuick Read: Higher Team ASI + Lower Static Rate = better off-ball support culture. Avg Active Supporters shows intensity — teams averaging 3+ are creating strong movement."

    "text": "Abstract\n\nIntroduction\nOn average, players spend 98% of a match without the ball, yet football analytics overwhelmingly focuses on the 2% with it. With the latest advancements in computer vision, a golden opportunity to derive metrics and insights from off-ball movement is now possible.\nCore Question: When a ball carrier is pressured, how actively do teammates move to provide passing options?\nThis research introduces the Active Support Index (ASI), a metric framework leveraging SkillCorner tracking and dynamic event data to measure teammate support during pressure moments, validated against season-level physical output. Applications include identifying players who consistently provide active support, diagnosing static tendencies for coaching intervention, and comparing team tactical styles.\n\n\nMethods\nWe analyzed 10 A-League 2024/25 matches containing 7,063 pressure events using SkillCorner’s 10fps tracking data. Player velocities were calculated using a Savitzky-Golay filter (window=7 frames, polynomial degree=2) applied to positional data.\nMetric Definitions:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLevel\nMetric\nFormula\n\n\n\n\nPer Event\nActive Support Ratio\n\\(\\frac{\\text{Active Supporters}}{\\text{Nearby Teammates}}\\)\n\n\nPer Player\nPlayer ASI\n\\(\\frac{\\text{Active Support Count}}{\\text{Support Opportunities}}\\)\n\n\nPer Team\nTeam ASI\n\\(1 - \\text{Static Rate}\\)\n\n\n\nKey Definitions: - Active Supporter: Teammate within 35m of the pressed player AND moving &gt;2 m/s - Static Rate: Proportion of pressure events with zero active supporters - Proximity threshold (35m): Maximum realistic passing range under pressure - Velocity threshold (2 m/s): Boundary separating walking from jogging/running\nFor validation, we compared player ASI scores (calculated from 10 tracking matches) against season-level physical aggregates from 175 A-League matches, specifically meters per minute during team possession (total_metersperminute_full_tip).\n\n\nResults\nSingle Event Analysis\nFigure 1 shows a pressure event with low Active Support Ratio where only 1 of 9 nearby teammates (11%) was actively moving—8 teammates were static.\n\n\n\nFigure 1\n\n\nValidation with Physical Aggregates\nASI correlates strongly with season-level physical output (r = 0.74, p &lt; 0.001, n = 167). Players in the top ASI quartile cover 153.2 m/min versus 128.8 m/min for the bottom quartile—a 19% difference (Figure 2).\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\nAdditional Findings\n\nPosition Validation: ASI aligns with expected positional demands. Midfielders average 59.4% ASI versus 45.2% for defenders (p &lt; 0.001).\nTeam Differentiation: Team ASI ranges from Perth Glory (98.3%) to Macarthur FC (91.5%), a 7-point spread indicating ASI can differentiate team off-ball movement cultures.\nFatigue Analysis: 58% of players (n=151) showed declining ASI in the second half, with average support ratio dropping from 53.7% to 53.1% (p = 0.46, not significant).\n\n\n\nConclusion\nThe Active Support Index provides a quantitative framework for measuring off-ball support during pressure events. The strong correlation with independent physical aggregate data (r = 0.74 across 175 matches) validates that ASI captures real physical behavior rather than arbitrary thresholds. Applications include identifying players who consistently provide active support under pressure, diagnosing static tendencies for coaching intervention, and comparing team tactical styles."
