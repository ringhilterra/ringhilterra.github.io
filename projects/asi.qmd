## Overview

A novel metric for quantifying off-ball movement during pressure situations, developed for the SkillCorner x PySport Analytics Cup (2025-2026).

## The Problem

When a teammate is under pressure, what makes good off-ball support? We intuitively know when teammates "show for the ball" vs. hide from it. But can we quantify it?

## The Solution

ASI measures how actively teammates support the ball carrier during pressure situations. It captures positioning, movement toward passing lanes, and availability as an outlet.

## Data

- 10 A-League 2024/25 matches
- 7,063 pressure events
- 8+ million tracking data points from SkillCorner

## Validation

ASI correlated strongly with physical performance metrics (r=0.74, p<0.001). Players who score higher on ASI tend to be the ones covering more ground and making themselves available. The metric appears to capture something real.
